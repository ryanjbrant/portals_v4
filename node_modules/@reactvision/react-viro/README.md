# ViroReact

ViroReact is a library for developers to rapidly build augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences. Developers write in React Native and Viro runs their code natively across all mobile VR (including Google Daydream, Samsung Gear VR, and Google Cardboard for iOS and Android) and AR (iOS ARKit and Android ARCore) platforms.

# Documentation

[Documentation can be found here](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/overview). While we do our best to keep all documentation up to date you may come across issues with broken links or outdated code samples If you do come across any issues please do let us know by either submitting an edit or [get in touch on Discord.](https://discord.gg/H3ksm5NhzT)

## Getting Started

If you are starting a fresh project with ViroReact, consider cloning one of our starter kits:

- [Expo + TypeScript](https://github.com/ReactVision/expo-starter-kit-typescript)
- [React Native](https://github.com/ReactVision/starter-kit)
- [Expo + JavaScript](https://github.com/ReactVision/expo-starter-kit)

# Examples

Check out the [examples](./examples) directory for sample code demonstrating how to use ViroReact with automatic architecture detection and other features.

You can also see our [Example projects](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/examples) page. These are a little old (~2019) but are a great reference point for how to use bits of the library.

# Connect with the ReactVision Community

Whether you're looking for support with building your AR or VR application or you want to contribute to ViroReact, the best way to contact our team and connect with the ReactVision Community is via Discord.

# A little history...

ViroReact was originally developed by the [Viro Media](http://www.viromedia.com/), but was open-sourced in 2019. In late 2020, the Viro Community was formed to help maintain and move the project onwards, updating it so it could run with modern versions of React Native, and start to add in new features.

Following years of support, in 2025, [Morrow acquired ReactVision](https://www.themorrow.digital/blog/morrow-acquires-reactvision-and-viroreact-library) to help accelerate its development and give it the resources needed to enable ReactVision to capture the rapidly growing demand for ViroReact. ReactVision now has a team working full-time to help ensure the codebase is updated and ready for the future of XR / Spatial Computing. Our vision is to enable React Native developers to build AR and VR applications that can run across all XR devices (smartphones, smart glasses, and headsets) off of a single React Native codebase.

We, as a community, owe a great debt to Viro Media and the people who developed this library originally. We hope to make them proud as it continues to develop and grow within ReactVision.
